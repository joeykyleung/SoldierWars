# SoldierWars

A modern Java implementation of the classic iPod parachute game, featuring multithreading, real-time combat mechanics, and progressive difficulty levels.

## ðŸŽ® Game Overview
SoldierWars is an action-packed tank combat game where players control a tank to defend against incoming enemies. The game implements multiple threading for smooth gameplay and entity management, along with a sophisticated collision detection system.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Key Technical Features
- **Multithreading Architecture**: Implements separate threads for:
  - Game loop management
  - Enemy spawning and movement
  - Projectile physics
  - Collision detection
  - UI updates
- **Real-time Physics**: Custom implementation of projectile trajectories and collision detection
- **State Management**: Dynamic game state handling for seamless level progression
- **Resource Management**: Efficient memory usage for sprite handling and game assets

### Technical Challenges & Solutions
1. **Concurrent Entity Management**
   - Challenge: Managing multiple moving entities (enemies, projectiles, effects) without performance degradation
   - Solution: Implemented thread pools and efficient entity lifecycle management
   
2. **Collision Detection**
   - Challenge: Real-time collision detection between multiple moving objects
   - Solution: Utilized spatial partitioning for optimized collision checks

3. **Game State Synchronization**
   - Challenge: Maintaining consistent game state across multiple threads
   - Solution: Implemented thread-safe state management using synchronization primitives

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Features
- Multiple progressive difficulty levels
- Boss battle system
- Dynamic resource management (health/ammo trade-off system)
- Real-time combat mechanics
- Special effects (fireballs, explosions)

## ðŸŽ® Controls
- **Space Bar**: Fire cannon
- **H**: Trade health for ammo
- **R**: Restart game
- **Arrow Keys**: Move tank
